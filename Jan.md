# January Logs

# Week 1
 - Goal: Cellular Automata, Conway's game of life
 - Interesting algorithm, but no real world use cases that I know of, beyond terraria and other simulations
 - Could it used by some Cybersecurity Neighboring device issues or something?
 - Used In a Minecraft Simulation once, was really powerful at state tracking/mimicking natural processes

# Week 2
 - Goal: Look into how genetic algorithms work
