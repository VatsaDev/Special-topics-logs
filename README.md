# Special-topics-logs
Keep track of the stuff I've done for special topics

Ultimate Goal:
 - RL simulation with multiple animals in multiple environments
 - an optimization mixture of both animal bodies and values for that combines neural nets and genetic algo. 
 - brain mechanics and evolutionary mechanics
 - Observe Local minima and a combination of NN with genetic algorithms, simulate mini evolution?
